# Superstore Sales and Profitability Analysis Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Goal
To analyze four years of sales data to identify key trends, geographic weaknesses, and unprofitable product categories that are contributing to stagnant profit growth, and to provide actionable business recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Google Sheets (for initial cleanup and creating the 'Processing Days' calculation).
* **Visualization & Analysis:** Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public.
* **Source Code & Documentation:** GitHub.

## 📊 Key Insights
The analysis revealed critical areas for intervention:

1.  **Profitability is Highly Uneven:** The map clearly shows that states in the Central/East regions (like **Texas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania**) are primary centers for losses, substantially dragging down overall company profit.
2.  **Stagnant Profit Despite Sales Growth:** The trend chart shows that while **Sales** volume is consistently increasing, total **Profit** has remained flat over the four-year period. This indicates rising costs or poor pricing strategies are neutralizing revenue growth.
3.  **High-Loss Products:** Specific Sub-Categories, such as **Tables** and **Bookcases**, demonstrate negative profit ratios, meaning the cost of fulfillment is not covered by the revenue generated.

## 📈 Business Recommendations
Based on the data, the following two strategies are recommended:

1.  **Implement Geo-Targeted Loss Mitigation:** Review logistics and adjust pricing or shipping rules for the top three loss-incurring states to neutralize negative profit contributions.
2.  **Execute Product Portfolio Review:** Launch an immediate cost analysis on high-loss items like Tables. The company must either increase their price, find a cheaper supplier, or discontinue/replace them.
